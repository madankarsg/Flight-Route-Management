# Flight-Route-Management

    I have created  a graph storing names of the cities, flight number and cost of the flight.
    A function will accept two cities as input and find all possible flights providing flight number and 
    the cost of flight.
    List is in ascending order of costs.	
    Also we have provided functionality for adding extra cities in the graph.
    The structure of the graph is given in the presentation slides itself.
